## Gait Recognition 🚶


**Welcome to the Gait Recognition Project!**

🙋‍♀️ This project is in collaboration with SUTD and KLASS Pte. Ltd.
🌈 Contribution - This organization consists of code relating to training the model, performing silhouette extraction and a prototype displaying these AI models.
👩‍💻 References - More detailed information about gait recognition could be found at [OpenGait](https://github.com/ShiqiYu/OpenGait) and silhouette extraction at [MMdetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection)
🍿 We achieved **50%** accuracy in terms of the its rank-1 accuracy. This is 3% more than the current state-of-the-art models!
🧙 Thank you for reading and enjoy!
